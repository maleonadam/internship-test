## Running the program

For running the C code, you just need to have a valid C/C++ compiler installed on your computer

### Using the terminal

1. Compile the code using a C compiler. For example, you can use gcc by opening the terminal and running the following command:
   $gcc fibonacci.c -o fibonacci
   This command will generate an executable file named fibonacci
2. Run the compiled program by executing the following command:
   $./fibonacci
3. You will see the results printed on the screen

### Using the VS CODE IDE

1. Install VS Code IDE
2. Open the VS Code IDE and install C/C++ extensions e.g C/C++ Extension Pack, C/C++ Intellisence, Code Runner
3. Enable the Code-runner: Run In Terminal in settings
4. Run the code directly using the play button you'll find in the upper right corner
